- 😎 I practice what I learn through interface development challenges.
- 🤝 I'm looking to collaborate on projects.
- 👨‍💻 I will use Github as a portfolio for some of my projects and challenges I do. 
- 📚 I am also interested and curious about cybersecurity and UI & UX Design.
- 💭 I believe that even though evolution is individual, we need each other to achieve this purpose.
